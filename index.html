<p>Royal Robotics is a school-based team from Leadership Public Schools - Hayward. Our team is comprised of members who are passionate about robotics and believe it should be more accesible to youth from our community. LPS Hayward is a Title 1 school, and we are excited to be our school&#39;s first FTC team. In fact, we are the only registered FTC team from a public school in Hayward!</p>

<p>We are very greatful to have recieved a rookie grant from FIRST which allowed us to pay for registration, and our school for purchasing a starter kit for us. Additionally, we are very thankful to TechBrick from Maryland (https://www.techbrickprograms.com/) for their generous loan of an Expansion Hub to us (now out of stock!). Without this, we would not have any hope of particpating in the 2022 - 2023 season. However, we are still direly short of funds to register for competitions at NorthCal FTC and purchase a prepatory playing field.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000080;"><span style="font-size:28px;"><strong><a id="planned_outreach">Planned Outreach</a></strong></span></span></p>

<p>We understand how robotics is seldom accessible to those in Title 1 schools. Robotics is inherently very financially taxing due to all the electronic and structural components required, and requires expertise in programming. For this reason, we hope that when we are able to acquire excess funds, we use them to hold robotics sessions at the Hayward Weekes and Main library. Working with library staff, we will attempt to reserve a room and post on the library&#39;s website when we will be hosting the events (most likely weekly), where the youth are invited to learn how to build and program robots. Alternatively, if funds are short and we are not able to buy kits for outreach, we will use our team&#39;s main robot for demonstration purposes, allowing the youth to diassemble it and reconstruct it. The youth will learn the fundamentals of programming in Java and how it is applicable to robotics. We hope to foster the youth&#39;s interest in STEM, encourging them to pursue fields in math and science.<br />
<br />
The Bay Area is known for being the center of technology, yet, as mentioned previously, we are the only school in Hayward with a registered FTC team! We hope we can give the youth a hands-on experience that can very well shape their view on STEM as something boring and plain, to something exciting and worth pursuing.</p>
