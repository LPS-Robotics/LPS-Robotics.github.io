<p class="p-p">Royal      Robotics</p>
<p class="p-p1">  <span class="s-t">An FTC team from Hayward, California</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p-p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p-p3">About</p>
<p class="p-p4">Royal Robotics is a (soon to-be registered) FTC team in Hayward, California. Started in March of 2022 at Leadership Public Schools &ndash; Hayward, we seek to build interest in STEM in our small school and city &ndash; and generally, have a good time with robotics! So, for the first time ever, Leadership Public Schools has a robotics team!<br class="calibre2" />
<br class="calibre2" />
We are the second FTC team in Hayward.</p>
<p class="p-p4">Although we are not yet official registered, we currently have a FTC kit from GoBilda (courtesy of our school!) and a loaned RevRobotics Expansion Hub (courtesy of TechBrick from Maryland!).</p>

<p class="p-p11">How To Start an FTC Team</p>
<p class="p-p11">Sahil Sharma, June 9<span class="s-t4">th</span> 2022</p>
<p class="p-p11">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p-p12">Starting an FTC team can seem like a daunting task. And it often is. Kits are expensive, fundraising can seem foreign, and it’s easy to feel overwhelemed. We’ll share our story here, in hopes that it will help others.<br class="calibre2" />
<br class="calibre2" />
Perhaps the most important thing is to first take a look at FIRST’s website: <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc/start-a-team" class="s-t1">https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc/start-a-team</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p-p12">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p-p12">Again, it’s understandable that all the information can feel overwhelming! The first thing you must do is <span class="s-t5">find interested people</span>! Having people to support and help you will make this a much easier operation. Try to form a small group with people you know well, as this allows for better communication and lets you get started quicker.</p>
<p class="p-p12">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p-p12">After that, you’re going to want to look for grants to get registered. This brings us to a different point, ensure you start near the beginning of the school year! This is when all grants were available… If you start near the end of the year, like us, you’re going to need on either you school to provide funding for a kit (as our school did), or you’ll have to fundraise!Perhaps you can host a bake sale or some school event! Remember, schools sometimes have some allocated for STEM related activities, and don’t be afraid to ask them for some funding!<br class="calibre2" />
<br class="calibre2" />
Grant finder: <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/team-grants" class="s-t1">https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/team-grants</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p-p12">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p-p12">Currently, there is a rookie grant available. You’ll need a mentor / coach for your team to be eligible for the grant. Typically, a mentor has robotics experience. However, this isn’t always possible, so it’s also acceptable if your mentor is just a teacher you know well from your school.</p>
<p class="p-p12">Now you have a mentor, a team, and hopefully some funding! The next step is to buy a kit… If you search online, you should find one! We got ours from GoBilda, for 700 dollars. Note that there are discounts if your team is based from a school, or if you officially registered your team! Registering your team costs 250 dollars.</p>
<p class="p-p12">You’re also going to need a control computer, to get it started. A RevRobotics Expansion Hub, plus two Android phones should work… Currently all Rev hubs are out of stock, so you’ll need to be quick to purchase them with your funds when they come out. </p>
<p class="p-p12">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p-p12">This is basically how far along we are in the process. Once we finish building the kit, we’ll update this guide with information on how to start programming and <span class="s-t1">setting</span> up the wiring.</p>
